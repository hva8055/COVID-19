## 📌 Objectives

- Map regional GDP, unemployment, and investment across time and geography.
- Analyze economic patterns using machine learning and spatial regression.
- Visualize insights through interactive maps and charts.
- Provide actionable recommendations for stakeholders.

---

## 🧠 Key Features

- **Data Integration** from World Bank, IMF, OpenStreetMap, and national surveys.
- **Choropleth Maps**, **Bubble Maps**, and **Heatmaps** of economic indicators.
- **Spatial Econometrics**: Regression, clustering, and forecasting models.
- **Model Performance Tracking** using RMSE, MAE, and R².
- **Region-wise classification**: High-growth, moderate-growth, low-growth, emerging.
